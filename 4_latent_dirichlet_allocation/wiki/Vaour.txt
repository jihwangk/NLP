Vaour

On the north the commune borders the Tarn and Garonne department, and the rising land consists of a gray limestone "causse" stretching almost to the Averyon river seven or eight kilometers away. Below the commune to the south the landscape consists of the forest of Gr√©signe - the largest oak forest in the "midi" - its hills scattered with grassy meadows, and the vineyards of Gaillac.
