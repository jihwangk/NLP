Gloeoporus dichrous

Gloeoporus dichrous is a species of fungus in the family Meripilaceae. It is a plant pathogen. First described as "Polyporus dichrous" by Elias Magnus Fries in 1815, it was later transferred to the genus "Gloeoporus" by Italian mycologist Giacomo Bresadola in 1912. The variety "G.Â dichrous" var. "niger" (formerly known as "Ceriporiopsis nigra") was proposed in 2008 after molecular analysis revealed the two taxa were conspecific.
