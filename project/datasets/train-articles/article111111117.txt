Manchin says Democrats acted like babies at the SOTU (video) Personal Liberty Poll Exercise your right to vote.

Democrat West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin says his colleagues’ refusal to stand or applaud during President Donald Trump’s State of the Union speech was disrespectful and a signal that the party is more concerned with obstruction than it is with progress.

In a glaring sign of just how stupid and petty things have become in Washington these days, Manchin was invited on Fox News Tuesday morning to discuss how he was one of the only Democrats in the chamber for the State of the Union speech not looking as though Trump killed his grandma.

When others in his party declined to applaud even for the most uncontroversial of the president’s remarks, Manchin did.
He even stood for the president when Trump entered the room, a customary show of respect for the office in which his colleagues declined to participate.
